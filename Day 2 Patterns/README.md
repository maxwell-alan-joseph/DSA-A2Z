# 🚀 Day 2: Intermediate Pattern Programming  
Sharpening logic and visual symmetry through advanced nested loops  

## 📚 Prerequisites Covered
Carried forward from Day 1:
- ✅ Loops (for, while)
- ✅ Conditional branching (if/else)
- ✅ Console output formatting

## 🎯 Today's Focus: Intermediate Star Patterns  
Building symmetry and mastering center-aligned logic.

### ✅ Completed Patterns  
- 🔷 Diamond Star Pattern → `diamondStar.js`  
- 🔻 Inverted Star Pyramid → `invertedStarPyramid.js`  
- 🔺 Star Pyramid → `starPyramid.js`

## 💡 Key Learning  
Mastering spacing and alignment in patterns helped reinforce:
- Loop nesting with condition-based spacing
- Symmetric logic around midpoints
- Enhanced confidence in dry-run analysis of loops

> “First you learn the pattern, then you bend it.” – Today's practice was all about discipline and structure.
